## ABOUT

- There are only two services that require postgres in this repository. These are login and logout.
- Websocket that deals with realtime data does not require database here, instead it uses memory (temporary).

## BEFORE

Each of server and client folder has a readme file to help you start using the chat-app. Make sure you check those things out.

## CREDIT

This is a chat-app inspired by [this](https://github.com/dhij/go-next-ts_chat).
